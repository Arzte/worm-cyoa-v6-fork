# WIP Powers (Tier 1)

## (Mover/Shaker) Grand Unifying Force (Requires: Hero) 
You retain a connection to the grand unification epoch of the early stages of universe in which the four fundamental interactions; electromagnetism, strong and weak atomic forces as well as gravity were not yet distinct. You gain the capacity to intuitively work these forces to manipulate the laws of physics, though it will take an extensive amount of hard work and dedication. 

**2nd Trigger** You don't simply have the capacity to manipulate the rules of physics with the 4 fundamental forces of the universe, your existence unconsciously enforces it, a direct contradiction and negation to the power of the Siberian.

## (Breaker/Shaker/Brute) Manifold Form 
Your mind and body has been transformed into an intangible neutrino/quantum consciousness, fueled by the fires of naked singularities. Conventionally un-killable bar esoteric attacks like the bolts enhanced with Sting or the claws of the Siberian, you feed of the energy and matter of the universe you reside in to sustain itself, lest you disappear forever. You also gain an unusual high control over your gravitational field and can expel lethal amounts of gamma rays at your enemies  upon consuming vast quantities of energy and matter. 

**2nd Trigger** (requires Negentropy) Your very existence defines perpetuence Champion, you have no need for energy or matter to sustain yourself. Entropy no longer has hold over you, making you functionally immortal.

## (Mover/Shaker/Blaster) Planeswalker (Requires Doormaker) 
You gain the capacity to freely watch and traverse between all the dimensions and planes of the multiverse you reside in. Barriers put in place to prevent such travel will  not impede you.

**2nd trigger** Drawing upon  underlying background zero-point energy that exists in space throughout each universe in the multiverse you reside, you can create and utilize a   well of  near infinite energy called a  Multi-Dimensional Refraction Phenomenon to unleash upon your enemies on any parallel world.

## (Master/Striker/Trump) Shard Administration:
Every Parahuman you make physical contact with has their Shard controlled by your own. You can add or remove restrictions to any existing power (bar queen or vital shards), as well as change how they work entirely, as long as it's still related to the shard's original purpose. You can't edit your own powers or use it to create more of them.

**2nd Trigger** Your power and control has been extended to line of sight, which cannot be broken by anything short of a Parahuman dying or their Shard finding a new host. You can also now command vital and normal shards to bud off, destroy, or redistribute to anyone, inducing trigger events.
